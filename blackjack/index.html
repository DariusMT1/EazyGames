            <h2>How to Play Blackjack</h2>
            <p>Blackjack is a popular card game played in casinos. The goal of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.</p>
            <h3>Rules:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Each player starts with two cards, and the dealer also gets two cards, with one card face up and one face down.</li>
                <li>Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value. Face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10 points. Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points.</li>
                <li>Players can choose to "Hit" to take another card or "Stand" to keep their current hand.</li>
                <li>If a player's hand exceeds 21 points, they "bust" and lose the game.</li>
                <li>After all players have finished their turns, the dealer reveals their face-down card and must hit until their total is 17 or higher.</li>
                <li>If the dealer busts, all remaining players win. If the dealer does not bust, the player with the highest hand value that does not exceed 21 wins.</li>
                <li>If the player and dealer have the same hand value, it is a "push" and the player gets their bet back.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How to Play:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Click "Hit" to take another card.</li>
                <li>Click "Stand" to keep your current hand and end your turn.</li>
                <li>Click "Restart" to start a new game.</li>
            </ul>
